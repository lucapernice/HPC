# HPC Benchmarking and Mandelbrot Computation
## Overview
This repository contains scripts, results, and reports for two high-performance computing (HPC) projects:

- Benchmarking MPI Algorithms: Evaluating broadcast (Bcast) and barrier algorithms.
- Mandelbrot Set Computation: Parallel computation using MPI and OpenMP.
